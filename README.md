+ *Efficient implementation of tensors with vectorized operations, O(1) slicing and more*
+ *Fliexible computational graph supports NN architectures like ResNet*
+ *Efficient convolutions via stride trick (TODO)*
+ *A wide variety of optimizers (TODO)*
+ *Simple training process (TODO)*
+ *Comprehensible usage manual (TODO)*
